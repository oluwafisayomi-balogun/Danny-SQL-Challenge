# SQL-Projects
My repository showing in-depth knowledge of SQL using case studies in 8WeekSQLChallenge. 
The 8 Week SQL Challenge is started by Danny Ma which consists of different SQL challenges.

Each case-study folder contains the following files
> A readme file explaining the problem statement and datasets used
> SQL file to create the schema, tables and loading data
> MD files which contains SQL queries answering the respective challenge questions


Note:
Solutions are coded in SQLite
