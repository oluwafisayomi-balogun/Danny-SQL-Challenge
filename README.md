# Danny 8-week SQL Challenge
My repository showing in-depth knowledge of SQL using case studies in 8WeekSQLChallenge. 
The 8 Week SQL Challenge is started by Danny Ma which consists of different SQL challenges.

Each case-study folder contains the following files
> 1. A readme file explaining the problem statement and datasets used
> 2. SQL file to create the schema, tables and loading data
> 3. MD files which contains SQL queries answering the respective challenge questions


Note:
Solutions ending with .sql are coded in pgSQL
Solutions ending with .sqbpro are coded in sqLite
